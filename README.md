# Game-Hacking
The funny part about this repository is that it's hiding in plain site (pun intended). I've had many try to 
steal this, but I'm hosting it on a repository, on Github! Nobody really cares about my Github, 
or much of the work I do here anyways, so it doesn't really matter.

If you would like to add a new game, make a new issue, and say what you want, and what game.

OBVIOUSLY no flash. Flash. Is. Dead.
No online games either. Most (hopefully) online games do everything server side.
If there's an offline mode, maybe.

AGAIN! NO FLASH. [FLASH IS DEAD](https://www.wired.com/story/adobe-finally-kills-flash-dead/) AND IT WILL NEVER RECOVER!
